## About Me

I'm a backend-leaning fullstack engineer with experience delivering and
modernizing large-scale production systems in banking, fintech, and
energy domains.

My work focuses on:

-   Designing scalable microservices with clear DDD boundaries
-   Refactoring and progressively migrating legacy systems
-   Building event-driven architectures (Kafka / RabbitMQ)
-   Optimizing high-volume SQL systems
-   Establishing clean code and testing practices across teams

I operate comfortably in both **Greenfield and Brownfield** environments
and enjoy solving complex system evolution problems.

## Engineering Principles

-   Clean Architecture over framework-driven design
-   Explicit domain modeling (DDD)
-   Testability as a first-class concern
-   Observability & operational awareness
-   Sustainable refactoring of legacy systems
-   Clear commit hygiene and documentation

## Public Speaking

I regularly speak at European tech conferences on software engineering
topics including AI, testing, and legacy systems.

Conferences: - Devoxx France - Voxxed Days Luxembourg - Sunny Tech -
DevFest Paris - DevQuest - Normandie.AI (Keynote)

Topics include: - "The Legacy Code Dilemma: Maintain or Rewrite?" - AI
collaboration in software engineering - Delegating testing workflows to
AI systems

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What You'll Find on This GitHub

-   Architecture-focused backend projects
-   Event-driven system experiments
-   Kotlin / Spring production-style patterns
-   Clean code demonstrations
-   Messaging and distributed systems prototypes
-   Engineering explorations around AI + development workflows

I value clarity over cleverness and long-term maintainability over
short-term speed.
