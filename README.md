## 🧠 Algorithmic Thinking

I maintain algorithmic sharpness through regular problem solving and
competitive programming practice.

## About Me

I'm a backend-leaning fullstack engineer with experience delivering and
modernizing large-scale production systems in banking, fintech, and
energy domains.

My work focuses on:

-   Designing scalable microservices with clear DDD boundaries
-   Refactoring and progressively migrating legacy systems
-   Building event-driven architectures (Kafka / RabbitMQ)
-   Optimizing high-volume SQL systems
-   Establishing clean code and testing practices across teams

I operate effectively in both Greenfield and complex Brownfield
environments and enjoy solving complex system evolution problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Systems Thinking

I focus on:

-   Tradeoff analysis over dogmatic decisions
-   Incremental modernization over risky rewrites
-   Failure-mode awareness in distributed systems
-   Operational feedback loops (metrics, logs, observability)
-   Designing for evolvability, not just delivery

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Selected Experience Highlights

### 🏦 Large-Scale Banking System Rewrite
